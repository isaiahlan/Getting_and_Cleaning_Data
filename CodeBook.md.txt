Getting and Cleaning Data

This is Isaiah Lan's CodeBook.md document for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course project from John Hopkins, Bloomberg School of Health. 

The following Dataset used for this course can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

I created the run_analysis.R script to preform the data clean up script for the assignment.

You will find that the clean data (tidydata that I created) merges both training and test sets provided from the coursera assignment.
The data extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (e.g. walking, standing, laying).
Creates another tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity/subject
